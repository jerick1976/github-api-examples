# github-api-examples

# Intent
The purpose of this repository is to provide quick and easy examples for new users of the Github API.  While not inclusive to all of the options available in the api, there is at least one example of each type of API call within the repository.  

Each example is setup to be support admin friendly.  Each should allow a user to plug in the variables needed to generate a successful call and optionally print out the resulting command and JSON data.  The initial examples are perl based simply due to laziness on the part of the creator.  Coding in other languages will follow as time permits

# Repository Organization
Examples are sorted by language and tagged by version.  Currently V3 is the only version supported within the examples.  However, once V4 or V3.X comes on the scene a tag will be set to mark the final release of V3 prior to migrating to V4.
